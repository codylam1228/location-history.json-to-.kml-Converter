# Interactive Google Location History to KML Converter with Map Visualization

## Project Overview
A single-page web application that converts Google Location History JSON files to KML format with interactive map visualization. Users can select multiple time periods, customize KML output settings, and preview their location data on OpenStreetMap before downloading the final KML files for use in Google Earth.

## Core Features

### 1. File Input & Validation
- **Input**: Single `location-history.json` file upload
- **File Size Handling**: 
  - Warning for files >100MB
  - Chunked processing (1000 records per chunk) to prevent browser freezing
  - Estimated processing time display based on file size
- **Validation**: JSON format validation with detailed error messages and suggestions
- **Auto-detection**: Automatically detect earliest and latest dates from the JSON file

### 2. Multi-Period Date Selection
- **Date Picker Interface**: 
  - Pre-populated with detected date range from JSON
  - Prevents invalid selections (end_date >= start_date)
  - Limits selection to available data range
- **Multiple Periods Support**:
  - Users can add multiple time periods (e.g., 1/9-3/9, 5/10-9/10)
  - Add/remove period buttons
  - Each period processes independently
- **Preview Information**:
  - Shows selected date ranges
  - Displays total data points for each period
  - Real-time validation feedback

### 3. KML Customization
- **Line Colors**: Basic color options (Red, Blue, Green)
- **Waypoint Styles**: Labels on waypoints + tickmarks + trackpoints
- **Global Settings**: All KML files use the same customization settings
- **Output Format**: Standard KML format compatible with Google Earth

### 4. Processing & Output
- **Processing Trigger**: Manual "Process" button activation
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows "Processing chunk X of Y" during large file processing
- **Multiple Output Files**: 
  - One KML file per period (e.g., `period1_output.kml`, `period2_output.kml`)
  - Automatic download prompts for each file
- **Error Recovery**: Instructions for retrying with smaller chunks if processing fails

### 5. Map Visualization
- **OpenStreetMap Integration**: Displays actual route lines between waypoints
- **Period Selector**: Button-based period selection for map display
- **Map Update**: Updates after user input (not real-time)
- **Route Display**: Clear and detailed path visualization
- **Navigation**: "Go to Map" button to access visualization step

### 6. User Interface
- **Single Page Application**: Scrollable interface with all steps
- **Tabbed Interface**: Both web and mobile versions use tabs for better organization
- **Responsive Design**: Separate mobile-optimized layout with full functionality
- **Step-by-Step Flow**: Clear progression through file upload, date selection, processing, and visualization

## Technical Requirements

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with File API support
- Appropriate messages for unsupported browsers
- No browser-specific dependencies

### Processing Architecture
- **Client-Side Processing**: All processing done in browser (no server storage)
- **Memory Management**: Chunked processing to handle large files
- **Performance**: Acceptable delay of few seconds for large files (<1GB)

### File Handling
- **Input**: Single `location-history.json` file per session
- **Output**: Multiple KML files based on selected periods
- **Format**: Standard KML format for Google Earth compatibility

- Basic error handling

### Phase 2: Date Selection Interface
- Date picker components
- Multi-period management
- Validation and preview systems

### Phase 3: Processing Engine
- Chunked processing implementation
- KML generation with customization options
- Progress tracking and error recovery

### Phase 4: Map Visualization
- OpenStreetMap integration
- Period selector for map display
- Route visualization

### Phase 5: UI/UX & Mobile
- Tabbed interface implementation
- Mobile-responsive design
- Cross-browser compatibility

### Phase 6: Testing & Optimization
- Performance testing with large files
- Browser compatibility testing
- Mobile device testing

## User Experience Flow

1. **File Upload**: User selects `location-history.json` file
2. **Date Selection**: User configures one or more time periods
3. **Processing**: User clicks "Process" button and waits for completion
4. **Map Preview**: User can view routes on OpenStreetMap by period
5. **Download**: User downloads KML files for each period
6. **Google Earth**: User opens KML files in Google Earth

## Success Criteria
- Successfully process files up to 1GB in size
- Support multiple time period selections
- Generate valid KML files for Google Earth
- Provide clear map visualization on OpenStreetMap
- Work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices
- Handle errors gracefully with helpful user guidance
